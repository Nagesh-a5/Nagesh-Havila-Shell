Bacon is cured through either a process of injecting with or soaking in brine, known as wet curing, 
or using plain crystal salt, known as dry curing.[1][6] Bacon brine has added curing ingredients, most notably sodium nitrite (
or less often, potassium nitrate), which speed the curing and stabilize color. Fresh bacon may then be dried for weeks or months in cold air, 
or it may be smoked or boiled.[1] Fresh and dried bacon are typically cooked before eating, often by pan frying. Boiled bacon is ready to eat, 
as is some smoked bacon, but they may be cooked further before eating. Differing flavours can be achieved by using various types of wood, 
or less common fuels such as corn cobs or peat. This process can take up to eighteen hours, depending on the intensity of the flavour desired. 
The Virginia Housewife (1824), thought to be one of the earliest American cookbooks, gives no indication that bacon is ever not smoked, though 
it gives no advice on flavouring, noting only that care should be taken lest the fire get too hot.[7] In early American history, the curing and smoking 
of bacon (like the making of sausage) seems to have been one of the few food-preparation processes not divided by gender.[8]
Bacon is distinguished from other salt-cured pork by differences in the cuts of meat used and in the brine or dry packing. Historically, 
the terms "ham" and "bacon" referred to different cuts of meat that were brined or packed identically, often together in the same barrel. 
Today, ham is defined as coming from the hind portion of the pig and brine specifically for curing ham includes a greater amount of sugar, 
while bacon is less sweet, though ingredients such as brown sugar or maple syrup are used for flavor. Bacon is similar to salt pork, which in 
modern times is often prepared from similar cuts, but salt pork is never smoked, and has a much higher salt content.[9]
For safety, bacon may be treated to prevent trichinosis,[10] caused by Trichinella, a parasitic roundworm which can be 
destroyed by heating, freezing, drying, or smoking.[11] Sodium polyphosphates, such as sodium triphosphate, may also be 
added to make the product easier to slice and to reduce spattering when the bacon is pan-fried.
